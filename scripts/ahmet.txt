Wonderful news!
- Next up is twice as many vaccinated as cases. Let's hope to hit that by the end of the month. And that rate of new cases just keeps plummeting, largely thanks to the vaccines, while the rate of vaccine doses given has been increasing in that same time.

In the first week of January, there was an average of 260,000 new cases and 500,000 vaccine doses given every day. At the end of January, it was an average of 150,000 new cases and 1,300,000 vaccine doses given every day.

It's kind of hard to overstate what a dramatic turn around last month was for the state of the virus in the United States. We went from the absolute worst of it to a precipitous decline that isn't showing any signs of letting up. We're a lot closer to the end than a lot of people are saying. This is very, very exciting.
-- I agree. I actually look forward to looking at the cases vs vaccination daily numbers now. :)
--- I want World omelets to add a column for vaccination numbers in their tracker!

Edit - worldometers* lmao
---- World omelet makes me think of the giant omelet on neopets lmfaooooo
----- That omelet was the MVP. Same with Jelly world and the soup kitchen
------ Right?? I was so excited to go get my slice everyday 😂😂😂
------- Did someone say soup kitchen, don't get me so excited
------ Jesus I haven't thought about Neopets in years!
----- Haha!
------ I don’t know about you but I could sure go for a World omelet right now... they’re fucking delicious!
------- I bet. I imagine the ass burgers must be getting old.
------ Yes!  We go from a world pandemic to  a world omelet!  You are brilliant, Skeepidy!  I’ll take mine with feta cheese and spinach.
------- Go drunk autocorrect, you’re home!
-------- Hmm. Vaccinations delivered in omelet form? I'll invest!
--------- Thank you for leaving that in there. It gave me my first good laugh of the day!
---------- Mmmm, omelets from around the world!
----------- Is that a giant omelet or an omelet for everybody??
---- It’s only around 2:1 in NYC (daily count) unfortunately. We just don’t have the supply yet.
----- Completely anecdotal, but rural areas and smaller population states seem to be rolling it out a bit faster. 

The logistics of distribution in large cities is a bit more of a challenge, so they seem to be lagging a bit in terms of  people getting the vaccine and with the prevalence of virus transmission in urban areas, you've got two factors working against big cities. 

Betting they catch-up in the next few weeks (my city has setup 3 new "vaccine super centers" in the last week or two, for instance, but takes a while to first get the supply and second to train/hire people to work the vaccine centers.
------ I'm skeptical that's the issue. 

NYC is vaccinating large numbers of people from outside NY.  I'm guessing it's the same in other cities too. anyone who works in NY and lives in NJ or CT can get vaccinated in NY. And we really don't have the supply to do much more.
------- Not that I don't believe you but can you source that for me?  The fact that I'm still not eligible yet despite my job and actively living here while people from out of state get our (NY citizens) shots is extremely infuriating.
-------- I don’t know the specifics on NYC, but vaccine tourism does seem to be a thing now:

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/31/us-vaccine-tourism-state-borders-covid-19-shots?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other
--------- Wow I had no idea it went this big!  I could buy people employed in neighboring states getting a shot but that article had it all, cross country hell even cross national borders!

Thanks for the article.
-------- California still doesn’t have enough doses
--------- Yeah, that's definitely a part of it and we're seeing it out west too. 

The City of LA that houses the big vaccination centers has around 4 million people, but the county as a whole has over 10 million. Same with San Diego, which has a population of around 1 million, but the greater county is around 3 million. So, lots of demand from the surrounding areas as well.
---------- But that wouldn’t affect the numbers reported.
------ NYC looks like they are doing about 20,000 vaccines per day. Not sure what you are talking about.
----- FYI the actual number of infections is probably much greater than the reported number. Possibly 30% to 50% higher.
--- >	Next up is twice as many vaccinated as cases. Let's hope to hit that by the end of the month.

I’m doing my part! 

I’ve vaccinated ~600 people so far. In a career that has become about as soul-wrenching as they come (retail pharmacist), it feels great to really be providing a key service to so many people. Everyone is so appreciative of what I’m doing all of a sudden, instead of just constantly complaining. I can actually say that even though it has been complete and total chaos these last few weeks, I’m actually liking my job right now.
---- Honestly pharmacist don't get the love that they should. Pharmacist mixed my chemo that killed my leukemia.  A pharmacist noticed a potentially fatal drug interaction and got the doctor on the phone to get me an antibiotic that worked and didn't interact with the heart meda I was on from the chemo.
----- TBH I like retail pharmacists. I love asking them questions about the medicines I've been prescribed. Also love surprising them sometimes knowing about the said drug. Really pharmacists are cool. In a sense you're a legal drug Lord. Lul.
------ Keep it up!  It has to feel empowering to have such a tangible positive impact at work.   I have helped recently assisting a health care organization with their vaccine information roll out and that has been really gratifying to do.   2021 is showing improvement for sure.
------- You're a hero!
-------- If it makes ya feel any better, I don't think I've ever met a pharmacist I didn't think was cool. I really appreciate the work you do! Thanks :)
---- :: cries in Florida ::

I have no idea how I’m supposed to get a vax in this state so I’m clinging to your every word. I’m under 65, but have a lung thing. Called my doc and I’m on a waiting list.
----- Publix was distributing vaccines by county, I think. You technically logged in at 6 am and made an appt, but if you logged on the night before and just kept the website on, you were quietly put in a virtual queue.  First come, first serve.
------ Figured that might be how it went. Damn
----- Haven't kept up with covid news since December and reading this brought tears to my eyes. I fucking love science!!
------ "It is going to get worse before it gets better" comments are history.  Knock on wood.
------- [deleted]
-------- We had to go through a few "gets worse" phases
-------- They aren’t though. Osterholm thinks the worst is yet to come when the variants hit hard in March. I’m not sure I believe it but he has a lot of credentials.
--------- He was predicting 500K deaths by Octuber of last year.

He is very credentialed but he also has been proved wrong.
---------- Was he though? He always quantified his statement with, if nothing changes. 400k people died.
----------- Yes. He was off by several months. Things is that he always tend to speak in broader terms which gives him room to atone for his shortcomings.
------------ No, he always quantified. If I tell you, you will get hit by a car if you stand on the road at 12 pm. But then around 11:59pm, you moved out of the road, was i wrong, or did changing your behavior as the result of my warnings change the outcome? The answer is the latter.
------------- The Covid death number is a known undercount - not gospel.
------------ and that is without looking at excess deaths, which indeed exceeded half a million by then.
------------- Yes, Osterholm is an unmitigated quack. The worst is not in front of us, and we do not have a category 5 COVID hurricane churning out at sea.
-------------- So what's he saying? If nothing changes the worst is still to come?
------- Hi, sorry, I cried reading your comment. Hoping you’re right.
-------- This is very exciting news but let’s not forget that 95,000 people died in January. We need the number of vaccines administered per day to ramp up quickly. The federal government needs to step in and make sure states are making the best use of the vaccine and all states are receiving enough vaccines to cover everyone in groups 1A,B and C
--------- The only limitation our country has is supply; ~350MM (350,000,000) people in the US x 2 = ~700MM (700,000,000) doses needed
---------- Remember at least rn only adults can get these vaccines, which pulls a large amount of the population.
----------- Yep. And the vaccines haven’t been approved for anyone younger than 16 so we don’t even need the full 350 million. I saw Biden saying that everyone who wants a vaccine will have one by end of summer but I’m not seeing any realistic path to that goal. It’s one thing to order and pay for the vaccine. It’s completely different to get it to the people
------------ We’ll get to a point where the only constraint is supply.  Mass vaccination sites set up around the country will speed things up massively.  Single dose vaccines will also be instrumental in speeding things up.
--------- [removed]
---------- Eh...even his team and other doctors said you can’t expect too much from them in the first couple weeks.  They’ve been on record practically saying they can’t figure out where the Excel file is with vaccine inventory.   It’ll get better because we’re past the election and the team is better.  However crediting Biden is premature. His impact won’t kick in for a couple of weeks.
----------- [removed]
------------ People just want everything to instantly get better now that Trump’s gone so they can say “I told you so”. Now I do believe that the US would’ve handled covid much better under different leadership, but it still would’ve hit extremely hard. Biden seems to be moving things in the right direction, but it’s going to take time.
------------- The nice thing about "I told you so"s is they have an excellent shelf life. They can stay in the cupboard for a while longer until we've finished cleaning house.
------------- I’d agree that were still seeing the Trump vaccination plan.  That being said, I feel like even just the messaging makes me more optimistic.  I feel like the new administration will tell us the truth and we aren’t being gaslit.  The anxiety of having zero fucking clue about the veracity of anything coming out of previous administration’s mouth is refreshing.
-------------- I feel so much more optimistic that there's not a new WTF beyond the pale thing the President did in the news every day or two.  Even if he's not able to really improve things yet, at least they've stopped getting worse.  I'm still a bit worried about another coup attempt.
------------ It's less about what is possible and more about not actively harming what might be possible. It's not magic, but the amount of times the Trump admin took something fairly benign and politicized it really hurt our chances as a country. Or some Trump appointee totally screwed the pooch because they spent all their time catering to making Trump happy and not doing their job.
------------- Just the concept of sitting back and letting people do their jobs without them being reprimanded is a huge improvement from the previous administration.
-------------- [removed]
--------------- Its getting better because we are passed the holidays and the vaccine is getting to more and more people. Not a single politician or election gets credit for that.
---------------- Disagree. If Trump were still in charge, the country would be ripping itself apart over who gets the vaccine first, with Trump leading the charge.
----------------- I’ll credit him for just allowing scientific discussions and a mask mandate.
---------- Keep that momentum rolling!! Hoping for summer vacations that feel somewhat normal
----------- One thing I'm not excited for... When this gets under control from the extensive work... The MAGAts with their "see, covid wasn't real! They just used it to make trump look bad!" spiel AND I BET YOU DOLLARS TO JELLY DONUTS that they say that.
------------ Who gives a shit what they think or say.
------------ I feel optimistic too. Once we get the 65+ population vaccinated, hospitalizations and deaths will plummet. I'm hopeful that will happen by April.
------------- > And that rate of new cases just keeps plummeting, largely thanks to the vaccines

Largely?  No.  A small part?  Yes.  

We need to hit well beyond 50% with antibodies to hit herd immunity.  We've only vaccinated less than 10% of the US, with well less than that having their 2nd dose. 

Most of nationwide drop in COVID-19 cases is simply due to states passing through their winter waves.  Northern plain and midwest states got hit HARD several weeks ago and since got past their peaks, with cases dropping fast.  States like California, Arizona, Texas, and Georgia are more recently coming out of their waves.
-------------- We also have people who've had the virus that have immunity as well.
--------------- Right, perhaps as much as 20-30% of the country has COVID-19 antibodies from being infected.  That's not herd immunity either. 

But the original claim was this big drop in cases was due to vaccinations, which isn't correct.  The current drop is largely due to states getting past winter waves.  

North Dakota, for example, started dropping well before people in that state were being significantly vaccinated.  Their winter wave started earlier and ended earlier than the rest of states.  States like California is doing through a similar trend as northern midwest states did, just weeks delayed.
---------------- Right, but we're getting closer every day. And every vaccination brings us closer to R0 of <1.
----------------- Why would all the winter waves just be disappearing on their own?  If there's still people to infect then it should keep growing until it does reach some kind of herd immunity, so it must either be that they're seeing herd immunity or the lockdowns/changes in behaviour are slowing down the spread.
------------------ Because people aren't gathering for Thanksgiving/christmas/new years. There are simply less opportunities for spread.
--------------- You don't need herd immunity to have reduced spread. Herd immunity is the end goal when enough people are immune that it literally cannot spread widely. 

That's not the same as having the spread slow.
-------------- Today my husband and I attended an info session for Montessori preschool for our baby who was born during the pandemic. Optimistic that he will get to start in the fall!
--------------- Isnt the recent decline more to do with less travel? The decline began on Jan 10thish, about what would have been expected after Christmas and New Years.

I suspect that in the next weeks though, the vaccines will start to show their impact
---------------- And remember: this was President Trump. President Biden will only have been in office long enough to start affecting......now!
----------------- Hi, I saw your flair, and so I felt this was as good as any place to ask. Are you sure we are seeing cases fall from vaccination? As of a week ago, we only had 3% of the population vaccinated. And only 9% of the high risk population. Is it cases are falling because vaccinations are working, or did cases fall because we finally cleared the “Christmas and New Years Death Zone” where many people who should know better disregarded public health guidelines because of the holiday and general COVID fatigue.

This is awesome! Always thirsty for good news these days.
- We’ve had some pretty good news this year though
-- Change in management was good
--- Tbh I feel like this would have happened regardless since it hasn't even bee that long, but at least management now is less erratic.
---- From what I have read Trump didnt really have a distribution plan for the vaccine. Colorado just released their vaccine rollout plan on the 26th I believe. My parents are both vaccinated and my workplace makes us eligible to get the vaccine before winter ends. I saw no plans prior. My parent in the medical field said that it was looking grim at the beginning of the year and didnt think they would be vaccinated until the spring.
----- As best I can tell, the plan was to disperse it to various hub hospital/clinics and let them sort it out from there.   While the hospitals are capable of dispersing vaccines among their essential staff, and ultimately patients that are seen there, they don't really have any kind of mass vaccination plan, which would generally fall under the public health department.   The fact that there was almost no plan in place after over 7 months about how to distribute the vaccine (besides medical essential workers and nursing home residents and staff first, which takes all of 5 seconds to come up with) is really a pathetic failure of government in general.

People should have been signing up for a waiting list for the vaccine in July.
----- Yeah this news is separate from the good news of the management change.
------ [removed]
------- He wouldn't have made any effort to ensure it was distributed evenly, but he also wasn't getting at all involved in how it was distributed. They just sent shipments of vaccine to the states, then threw their hands up and said "you figure it out."

Real profile in leadership there.
---- [deleted]
-- Same. Slurp slurp.
--- UK here. Same. We’ve not exactly covered ourselves in glory the last few years but we’re absolutely nailing the vaccines. 1 in 5 adults now vaccinated and we’ve procured billions and ramping up manufacturing massively. Once we’re done we can start distributing them to the world. We’re also one of the biggest contributors to Covax too. It’s a strange sensation to be pleased at what we’re doing.

A milestone that isn't a grim one? Hallelujah!
- yeah it took me a minute to process the title because I was trying to figure why having more vaccinations than cases was bad.

Eventually i realized this was a positive milestone!
-- I know was like WHAT MILESTONE NOW GODaMMIT
-- Right?! I was expecting to read a grim milestone
--- Same.
---- I was expecting 500k dead or something
---- That phrase was so disgustingly overused during the pandemic
--- Vaccination TO THE MOON 💉 🚀 🚀 🚀
---- 💎 ✋
---- Hopefully we see more uplifting milestones like this; no more headstones
----- It’s so... refreshing?
------ That’s fucking leadership in action!
------- So in 10 days they created more vaccines, put in better plans and logistics  and all was good in the world?

I get it, Trump is a moron, but Biden did not make this happen magically.
-------- It's not only about what Biden's team has done, but also about what they haven't done. The lack of lies and BS is surely helping things run more smoothly than they would have otherwise.
--------- We should probably stop attributing the successes and failures of a country with over 300 million people to a single person. Fuck that, we don't live in a monarchy.
---------- One thing that trickles down very effectively is leadership. Bad leaders stick up everything.
----------- A monarchy doesnt have to do with leadership.
England, The Netherlands etc all have monarchs that are head of state, but not head of government.

What you meant is an autocracy.
------------ [removed]
------------- Yeah, but athaliah specifically said “Biden’s team”, not “Biden”.
-------------- Failures absolutely can be attributed to a single person in a system like the US where you have too much power centralized to a single person and to only two parties. It's a lot easier to sabotage the system and cause failure than to be a very effective leader and single-handedly gain amazing success which as you said should not be attributed to a single person.
--------------- California covid situation started improving immediately after the Inauguration date. Did Biden really do that much in one day to improve the situation? No. Covid is all about timing. The situation was likely to improve after inaguaration regardless of who was in office. 

And no, I do not support Trump.
---------- Translation:  Biden has done nothing any different, but I'm a lefty so I can't admit that.
----------- [removed]
--------- Logistics and priorities is a big deal.
---------- We were already vaccinating 1mil people a day under Trump. Biden did the most genius thing when he said he’ll make sure we vaccinate 100mil in his first 100 days. Because do do that he literally has to do nothing but keep the current plan moving.  

Trump was so busy being Trump that he couldn’t even tout the vaccination program success, giving an easy A to Biden in his first 3 months.
----------- >We were already vaccinating 1mil people a day under Trump.

This was not even true. The highest it hit under Trump was 911k on January 19.
------------ [We did 1.6mil](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/22/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html) on Jan 22nd. Nothing Biden did had any effect on that.  Those vaccines were already in place. Those appointments were already scheduled. They were the result of the plan already in place.  

You can keep pushing this whole idiotic narrative, or just accept the reality that we had a good plan in place, it was working, and it got us to 1mil+ a day.
------------ [deleted]
------------- >I don't think that's true, and I can't really find numbers that say it's true

Yes, that's how the burden of proof works
-------------- https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-01-14/us-covid-vaccine-rollout-nears-1-million-doses-per-day
----------- No. I wish that was true. 

Setting a goal of 1 million vaccinations a day. Directing more resources with defence production act. 

Its all the small things that trump or his administration didn’t do.
------------ >Setting a goal of 1 million vaccinations a day. Directing more resources with defence production act.

I had Trump, but he was already hitting 1M/day when he left office.
------------ Can we just call him '45 instead of his name?
------------- [removed]
-------- So if we’re giving credit to Biden for all vaccinations under his administration he needs to be blamed for all the deaths and new cases as well? Do not conflate my criticism for Biden for support of Donald Trump.

Too many ppl seem to get that part fucked up.
--------- [removed]
--------- I didn't vote for nor support Trump but to credit this to Biden is beyond silly. We were going to hit this number whether or not Biden was the President. Not everything is political.
---------- Jesus just shut up.  I'm so tired of this bullshit. We've been doing a very good job getting vaccines in arms but a large percentage of people have been pretending that it isn't happening because they're worried it might reflect positively on Trump. Let's just all live in reality from now on
----------- this is a scary comment to read. this is how stupid people really are. wow . a rodent could understand this success took a year to manufacture by many people . to equate this to bidens leadership is and will probably always be one of the stupidest things ive ever read on reddit.
------------ States could not ramp up without knowing exactly what they were getting from week to week because we have to have enough for the second dose. That confidence was given last week. No over promising,  no under promising, no punishing, no rewarding states. This has already streamlined the process. Believe it or not,  federal vaccinations sites have been set up in less than a week.
------------ What’s been implemented?
------- I always knew I could laugh until I cried, but it took a pandemic to teach me I can cry until I laugh.
-------- Then I  wanted to read the top comments, and I’m happy to see the top ones aren’t “yeah but this this and this”. We need to take wins right now.
--------- It’s what happens when you have good leadership
---------- You understand the Biden administration is still ramping up on vaccination distribution data, right? The plan in place is heavily Trump administration's.   

No need for dishonesty.   
Good news is good news.

I'm getting my first dose tomorrow and I feels so nice to have the end in sight I could almost cry
- I’m getting my first shot tomorrow too! Cheers! :)
-- I just got mine tonight!! Cheers guys 🥂
-- Teacher over here 🙋🏻‍♀️ Our district scheduled us to get the first round of the Pfizer vaccine on Thursday. Couldn't be more thrilled to be one step closer to having our students back in the classroom!
--- *bUt TeAcHeRs JuSt WaNt To WeAr Pj'S aNd NoT wOrK*
--- Congrats!
---- Wait at least 2 weeks before bar hopping or karaoke 😀
----- Lol I don't even do that in normal times. However, movie theaters in my area are reopening and I'll be getting my second dose by early March, so I should be able to (safely) go see Godzilla vs Kong!
------ Yep that’s my plan too! I work in the film industry and I’ve just been dying to be able to even just walk into a theater again!
------- Oh my gosh I miss theaters so much!
----- Im Saturday. I feel like its xmas again. Lol
------ Have you seen the movie I am Legend? Perfect time to watch!
------- Congrats! Let us know how you felt afterwards.
-------- I cried on my appointment day. Second dose Saturday!

I got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccination today. I managed to get it despite being 29 and otherwise in perfect health because I volunteer at my local hospital. 

Glad to be in the 10% with the vaccine so far.
- Honestly at this point, I'm just glad that we're one person closer to herd imunity, regardless of your priority in line. Congrats to you, and soon more of us will be able to say the same!
-- It took me a while, but I think I'm at that point too. Every shot brings us one step closer to getting back to normal.
--- This is the way.
---- This is the way.
---- Wait what does that last word mean again? ... Normal? Huh, forget what that was
--- Same here.  Just get it into arms!  I’ll wait.  Fine.
-- Got invited by my hospital to receive it and kinda confused as to why I was selected. I’ll take it though.
--- Yeah same. I overheard other volunteers talking about getting the vaccine. They were all elderly; 60s and 70s so I figured that was why. Got an email from the volunteer coordinator inviting volunteers to sign up for it. I actually emailed her and asked if she sent it to me by accident. She said no, I was eligible to get it for volunteering. 

I didn't know I was getting the vaccine until 30 minutes before I got it earlier today. I was helping some older folks find their way to the vaccine clinic. I was offered the vaccine while at the clinic and so here I am now vaccinated. 

I volunteer at the hospital as a way to build my resume for the peace corps actually, the vaccine was never a thought in my mind. Thought I'd be waiting until winter.
---- Well obviously they want to prevent you from giving covid to the patients who are mostly elderly.
----- So much focus on who *deserves* to get the vaccine, but an argument could be made that the least deserving should be vaccinated first i.e. socialites who don’t take any precautions and spread the virus widely. But yeah, it’s good to vaccinate this person and any other youths who are going to be around old folks.
------ Similarly the people who are unable to social distance at work.
------- Yup. Real fuckin tired of stories about gas station cashiers and grocery workers dying or their loved ones dying because they were forced to clock in at the germ factory with inadequate protection. It looks like grocery store workers are getting prioritized in some places. Anyway, the main thing is to vaccinate as many as we can as fast as possible and not waste a single drop, and if our focus on “deserving” vs “undeserving” individuals inhibits that at all, it’s not good.
-------- Yeah I totally think who deserves it doesn't matter. The vaccines should go to the people that will most quickly stop the spread of the disease.

My grandma, who lives with my aunt and uncle, is particularly high risk. They both got the vaccine before her which at first sounds wrong. But they both volunteer at a shelter and have jobs where they need to be out in the world. My grandma has basically been at home the whole time so if the people who are going out have been vaccinated then she is that much safer. Now it's even better because they've all been vaccinated. And they even gave my other grandma the vaccine even though she'd had covid.

It's been a pretty large weight off my chest because I had to come to terms with the fact early in the pandemic that it was likely I wouldn't see them again.
------- That’s why I’m for younger people working in grocery stores or in schools getting it before some elderly people. In a lot of areas, they’re both currently eligible but elderly people are having issues getting appointments. Vaccinating the person around 100s or 1000s of people a few weeks before the 80 year old is going to help more.
---- Yeah i got an email from my new employer saying i was eligible and don’t really no why. I’m back end support and don’t work with patients ever. I sit in the airport office waiting for someone to pass away and donate their organs for a good cause and plan their flight to the recipient.
--- Honestly I support first come, first served for vaccines at this point. I work in healthcare and we’re giving patients a risk score and then inviting from the top down, and the high risk elderly patients are NOT checking their emails. Last time I checked there were 20,000 who had received their appointment invitation but hadn’t done anything with it. We’re having to send out snail mail invites and also putting people in charge of calling these elderly people one by one to get them to come in. Could have vaccinated far more people had we just done a first come, first served thing.
---- You know what, this is precisely what lead me to getting the vaccine today. I decided to ask one of the nurses administering vaccines that day about when I might be able to register. She said not until the 8th of February (8th is to register, not receive the vaccine) but if I happened to come to the covid clinic around noon, I might be able to get the vaccine if one of 18 (the hospital had only 18 doses remaining) scheduled people didn't show up to get their vaccine. Well, as it turns out 16 of the 18 showed up, 2 didn't and because of being in the right place at the right time I got the vaccine. Had I volunteered tomorrow instead of today I wouldn't have been able to get it until March according to the nurses administering the vaccines. 

Pure dumb luck.
----- I wish the system was better organized to do this. I can stay very available to get called in at the last minute, but there are people who are clearly higher priority than me. A system that could automate matching people with left over doses would be huge.
----- I'm in NJ and this is a HUGE issue because our governor told everyone to pre-register (requires email) and then the state would let you know when it's your turn. Well, group #2, behind medical/first responders was 75+.. followed by 65+ and those with medical conditions, and the vast majority had no idea what to do after signing up because, as you said, they don't check their email, if they have one at all. To complicate matters, we've got a ton of sites open, which of course is great, but a good half of them now have their own scheduling systems that seniors who don't use computers don't even know about. The state set juuuuust up a hotline that covers this but not until a few weeks into the rollout. I understand it's a lot of touch-and-go and figuring it out as we chug along but the hotline should have been open on day 1. Like, at this rate seniors are going to take the longest to vaccinate just because we have to freakin' get a hold of them!
---- Moderna for my father in law and me today. Keep this going!
----- I am glad to hear!
----- Got the Moderna vaccine yesterday, 42 and healthy. I signed up for a wait list at my local pharmacy after I found out that they had one due to people making appointments and cancelling. Evidently they would be thrown away if they don't find candidates.
------ Wow really. Which pharmacy is that ?
------- Pharmacy in a vons grocery store. But I live in California and the rules may be different from state to state.
------ I'm glad I'm not the only one! I just turned 30 and volunteer at a nursing home and received the vaccine. Onward to herd immunity!
------- Got my second Moderna dose this afternoon.  I've prepared for possible side effects.  I have PTO for tomorrow, plenty of books to read, my airpods are charged, I have cold chicken and salad so I don't have to cook, electrolyte water in case I don't want to eat--and snickerdoodles.
-------- Yeah it seems it can knock people out for a day or two if you're unlucky. On the flip side it can do nothing at all symptoms wise lol. I'll find out soon enough where I'll land.
--------- My first dose, hardly felt it, only had arm pain for a couple days afterwards.  I think it's the second dose that knocks people out.  Good luck to us both.
---------- You might be surprised! I fully prepared to feel like shit after my second shot, and I felt totally fine. Good luck!
---------- I got my first dose last night and am awake feeling shit - flu symptoms, fever, aching. If that’s a slice of what people have been experiencing then my heart breaks for them even more. But it’s nice knowing it’s just a reaction and that I’m not actually ill. Hope on the horizon!
----------- It varies so much. I've heard people say both doses knocked them on their asses. Others said the second dose knocked them on their ass. Others have said they experienced zero symptoms.

10 hours since I was stuck with the first dose and so far...nothing.
-------- Congrats! And thank you for your volunteer work.
--------- Do you have to have some medical training, or work in a medical field to volunteer?  

I would totally work for a few days, in exchange for early access to the vaccine

I just want to take my almost two year old places. The first summer she was so little we didn’t go anywhere, the second summer was COVID and now this summer I’m hopeful. My older kids have come up with a whole list of places they want to bring their sister to!
- Same! Weekends are rough, especially being stuck inside most of them because the wind hurts my face. We bundle up and face the elements sometimes but it sure would be nice to just..idk walk around the mall with her. Go to the aquarium. Something!
-- I completely agree. I miss just walking around the mall! Grabbing a soft pretzel or a coffee. Here’s hoping this summer is better!!
--- I would love to be a Target mom right now. Anywhere but this house please! I gave birth right before COVID. The first three months they advise you not to go anywhere crowded with your newborn so we didn’t go out much... and then COVID hit right after that 🤦🏻‍♀️ The mall sounds heavenly compared to this.
---- I was an up and coming Target mom. Before covid, my best friend and I would just walk around Target for hours, trying on clothes to buy, getting makeup, getting stuff for our homes, just hanging out there (a lot of the time we didn’t even get anything). Then going home and putting on said clothes and makeup and then going to a nightclub where you’re never less than six inches from someone, just partying and having that wonderful feeling of being so connected with the crowd (especially when a sing along song like Don’t Stop Believing, or Mr. Brightside came on). Just oh my god I miss the old world so much.
----- I don't even know what I'll do after covid... I used to follow this musician called Bassnectar on tours, and was going to go to a summer 2-night atlantic city bassnectar show, but of course all his shows were cancelled, and then *he* was cancelled.

Fucking cancel culture. :/ I miss traveling thousands of miles to have the time of my life with 10,000 of my friends and, well, there's other artists and festivals, but it just won't be the same without Bassnectar. Fuck :(
--- After watching Tiger King I decided to never visit the drive thru safari near my house.  A couple weekends ago we said fuck it and went because my two year old needed SOME sort of excitement in his life.
-- Its lucky they they are younger. Imo the people who have suffered the most are ages 8-16. 

Like you are becoming YOU during these ages. Lifetime best friends are made at school and sports. First crushes, kisses, hand holding, whatever.

Younger kids suffer as well, young adults too. But specifically this age range really is missing out imo.
--- As a 16 year old i definitely feel this but adults have it very bad too imo with work and stuff like that
---- Adults with kids sure. I can’t imagine how difficult that is. Those of us who are out of college, with a steady corporate job, and no kids have it the easiest by far. My social circle’s biggest loss is spending the last year of our 20s not partying or traveling.
----- Adults already did life though. Trust me. Its not that you are missing out on the best years of your life, you definitely are not. You are missing out on the FIRST years of your adult life.

You are missing out on weird little things that might shape you. A rejection or two, a fist fight, a friendship, a fling, a party, a mistake, whatever. A year of being 16 is like, 5 years of being in your 30s. 

You are living life on a different playing field than older people. We might be doing it better or enjoying it more, because we have experience. But we aren't missing as much, for the same reasons.
---- And single people without families. Those with families can bunker down with their families, single people living the single life suddenly find themselves with way less social options outside of the internet. A year is a long time.
----- 14 here. This is true
--- If it is any consolation, 2 year olds don't remember much, if anything.  It sucks YOU couldn't have the experience with her, but she won't be impacted by it.
---- They don't remember but they will be really happy which makes you happy as well. I think looking back some of our best memories as a family were the vacations.
----- Oh I know. But man is Mom-Guilt a real thing when your older two kids had big first birthday parties with friends and family and this one got a smash cake that I made and her family on zoom. I try not to let it bother me but it definitely does.
------ Yeah i totally get it.  

It is definitely something you realise tho as your kids get older.  0-5, they wont remember.  13-17, they dont wanna be by you anyway.  6-12?  Sweet spot for doing things/having experiences.
------- Absolutely!!!! Although my 9 year old daughter is already starting to not think I’m cool. 😂
-------- My daughter at 13 told me to ‘stop acting like you think you are cool!’

I informed her that i was not acting.  I am objectively cool.😎
-------- As a dad to a 5 yr old daughter who ADORES ME the strange positive to this whole thing is wfh. I see her off to school in the morning and when she gets home, I have so much more time with her just... Around me.

It would be nice to take her somewhere though...
---- I agree. I also would like to be able to take my not quite newborn anymore and older kids just...somewhere. We don’t go anywhere. I miss feeling safe just living every day.
----- Exact same boat as you.  My daughter turned 2 in September.  I can't wait to watch her interact with kids.  And masks, god damn I can't wait to get rid of the masks.  They've become a symbol of depression and anxiety for me at this point.
------ It’s so hard being a parent during these times. Not only are you trying to keep your kids safe and healthy but also worrying about their mental health and socialization. I’m lucky that my little one has two older siblings but I worry how she’ll interact with people once we can start to see people again. She really only knows us.
------- That's fantastic she has siblings at least.  My daughter only has us and dogs, lol.
-------- Same but instead of dogs... it’s goats. 😂
-------- Have a kid just shy of 3 who had pre-pneumonia the october/november right before covid.    Only child.  He occasionally sees a cousin a year older and teaching them to share together is a bit harder than I think it would have been had they both had more socialization earlier.  

Or kids are selfish... Here's to  hoping this summer will be better.
------- "No masks have to stick around forever so you can never forget about this traumatizing experience."

-This Sub
-------- I think at least wearing a mask when you’re sick and cant/won’t stay home from work would be a GREAT cultural change. The winter before Covid I had an older coworker who was doing netty pot nasal washes in our bathroom for like three weeks... so fucking gross. So many others got her cold too.
--------- Bingo. Then they say it’s realistic. Lol
------ I got to spend more time with my 15 month old because of covid but I also wish she had a more normal first 2 years.
------- My kids are the same way. I want to take them to a baseball game so bad!
-------- Oh my goodness same. Our first child was born at the end of February 2020, and before maternity leave was even over we went into quarantine. My family has been super careful and she has not met most of her family and has barely seen outside this home. Not at all what we expected her life to be like and I hope hope hope we will get through this soon.
--------- Oh man, we went to a Peppa Pig playground in Feb last year. Mine is four now, wanna take her back there again while she still likes it but she’s so grown up now.
---------- Same. I wanna take my boy to the zoo and the science center.
----------- In the same boat, my sisters are 2 and 4 and I've been talking about taking them to Disney World when this is all over since we live nearby. The younger one won't be able to do as much but I was surprised to see the older one is tall enough for most of the rides already! Their birthdays are both in July so really hope we can do it by then

---- Fortunately it’s been mild-to-moderate symptoms. I was surprised that I was able to go a full 10 months without getting it, but as a 20 year old on a college campus I was bound to run into it eventually. Wasn’t even from a massive college party either, just from casual contact with friends.
----- I’m surprised catching it from avoidable contact isn’t more embarrassing.
----- My 77 year old grandmother got it but she beat it like it was a cold. Likely will turn out okay for your parents too!
------ Glad she did ok!  My dad isn't as severe, cold like symptoms along with bad fatigue.. but my mom has double pneumonia from it.. she was stable enough the sent her home with lots of meds and oxygen but she's got a long road ahead

That is indeed good news.

Soon, it will just be the knuckleheads not getting vaccinated clogging the hospitals.
- All I care about is they’re not heavy in numbers that’ll still prevent things from being open again. If they don’t want to get vaccinated then that’s in them, but it won’t hold anything up.
-- I can't imagine keeping things shut down just because some dumbasses are afraid of getting tracked by Bill Gates or whatever.... nobody will have any sympathy for 'em.
--- I am one of 2 coworkers (there's about 12 people total) in my pharmacy who has chosen to get the vaccine (we all can get it in my county right now) I have at least 2 antivax coworkers, one other pharmacist who posts about it online and tells patients it's a government hoax. Stupidity really is the true disease because we wouldn't be this bad if we weren't so fucking stupid.
---- The real risk is these assholes will keep the virus churning in the population at low levels for long enough to spit out a vaccine resistant strain. Then we’re back at square one.
----- It's going to be doing that in either case.
------ The more spread, the more chances for mutation, the sooner that happens. Anti-vaxxers create consequences for all of us.
----- It will still be awhile before everyone that wants a vaccine can have one. Not forever but it wont be over for all just because it is for some. Some of those won't be able.to.end up in the hospital but will live life no fear still spreading it tomothers not as lucky to get the vaccine yet. Like some think open everything asap no masks etc. Just because some.have had the vaccine and numbers are improving not everyone has had their chance yet and it will still be a bit of time before they do. Hopefully they can get more.vaccine quicker.
------ People are looking at summer as a reasonable pivot point.  
Harsh truth:  we’re not keeping this up whether that means masks, distancing, no more stadiums, theaters, etc because some people can’t get the vaccine. That’s not how societies work.  The burden shifts to personal responsibility at that point.
------- The burden needs to shift when it’s an acceptable time to shift, which is nowhere near right now. Everyone who is physically healthy and able to get a vaccine should. I’m all about personal liberties, unless your liberties are infringing on the greater population’s safety and health.
-------- It will shift when supply overtakes demand.
-- And they're the ones to be worried about, especially if you're immuno deficient and the vaccine doesn't work on you...
--- well it will be interesting to see the social effects, will vaccinated people act reckless and not social distance leading to more people to break covid safe practices,
---- Realistically, vaccinated people really don't have much to worry about.

Technically it's more vaccinated than *confirmed* cases.

Bro what if we had competent leadership since this shit *started*
- Tbh this isn’t happening because a new administration suddenly took over. Vaccines wouldn’t have come out any faster
-- [removed]
--- Masks wouldn’t have been politicised nearly as much. Perhaps better stimulus for individuals to be able to cover expenses so they can stay home to lessen community spread. There would’ve been a lot of deaths and devastation, but not nearly to the degree it’s been this past year.
---- >Masks wouldn’t have been politicised nearly as much. 

I think a non-trump republican admin also would not have politicized the masks. Let's be real, 95% of the mask politicization was due to trump.
----- He made fun of Biden for wearing a mask during the god damn debate. Crazy
------ The damn debate he had covid during!!!!!
----- If I had to guess, I imagine we would have had a per capita death toll similar to Canada’s, which would be around 170,000 instead of +450,000. Still a staggering death toll in absolute numbers but proportionately less.
------ You’d also have to consider that Canada’s per capita death toll would likely be lower itself if the U.S.’s was lower. So probably an ever lower number by some small percentage than even 170,000.
------- That's true. I've read about anti-maskers in Alberta, and also just a ton of their cases were due to them getting the virus from Americans.
------- [removed]

------- [removed]
-------- [removed]
--------- >but on a practical level their results were never an option for us.

There are advantages to being a literal island. This is one of them.

Hawaii is also doing very well, for the same reasons.
---------- Science wasn’t the enemy before trump was in office. We listened to doctors. The information coming out at first wouldn’t have been so chaotic and we would have started off correctly.
------- The only reason they were politicized is because trump can’t admit he is wrong about anything for any reason.  At the beginning the guideline was “don’t wear a mask” because they were needed for first responders. Well that became written in stone as soon as trump said it.   You don’t see anyone railing against hand washing because trump said wash your hands from the beginning.
---- I'd like to think we could have done something more with the defense production act, maybe we could have had everyone in the US provided an N95 mask by Fall and not had such an awful Winter (getting them to use it may be another thing entirely but I think it could have helped).
----- I don't know, I was really watching the Dems when covid started, seeing if they were going to make a fuss about any alternative plan of action than what Trump was doing and it was complete crickets. The only thing Democrats were saying was, "listen to the science" without articulating exactly that was referring to.

I think the US was always going to be a disaster due to its complete lack of a national healthcare system and accompanying lack of national control of resources and pandemic preparation.

Consider that Gov Cuomo has overseen almost 50% reduction in hospital capacity over his career in order to make hospitals, which are businesses in America, more profitable.
------ So the party that wasn't in power, couldn't get honest information from the president, and kept saying we need a national mask mandate and we need more testing capacity and use the defense production act to build ventilators and please please please pass some fucking covid relief packages for people...those are the crickets you speak of?
------- It's always Cuomo or Newsom who speaks for all Dems, right? No need to look at others that managed to handle it better, it's easy to pick out scapegoats in solid blue territory and simultaneously demonize this damn city elites.

--- Vaccines wouldn’t have come out faster, but less people would have died.

And while the vaccine itself may not have been found faster, manufacturers would have been better prepared to ramp up production.

We would’ve had masks and PPE secured.  The trump administration ignored American manufacturers who wanted to ramp up production but needed federal dollars to explain capacity.  That impacted healthcare workers and causes shortages.

States would have had clearer guidance and had a consistent nationwide response.  Instead we have 50 states with 50 plans that has resulted in rich people traveling to Florida to skip lines or driving to poorer communities of color after taking up vaccine appointments online.  Poorer communities have a technology gap so older residents in poorer areas are less tech savvy and therefore able to book appointments.  That is happening in NYC.

More people would have taken things seriously and stayed home instead of believing it was a hoax or that there are miracle cures.

We’d also have better data instead of various states bungling death rates nationwide.  

With more vaccines, a better coordinated response, and people taking it seriously we might be able to vaccinate the country and offer help to poorer countries.

You seem to be ignoring that.
---- I was told Florida was a total disaster so why are people going there?
---- True. But you could argue case numbers would have been significantly lower under a competent administration. Also, there probably wouldn't be 20 million missing doses in a Kushner-less administration.
----- Or if we had an administration with *any* plan for vaccination........
------ Hey remember that time the previous administration literally funded and greenlit all of that vaccine development & production?
------- Remember when they didn't take any money for development and that administration didn't buy enough, lost track of millions of vaccines, and seized medical supplies to be auctioned off by their friends at the cost of states taxes?
------- Imagine actually thinking that this is due to an admin thats been there for less than 2 weeks, and not just a culmination of months of work.
-------- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Warp_Speed
--------- So you’re just gonna swallow that blatant propaganda full-throated?
------ Ironically case numbers would probably be higher because testing would have been much higher in the first spring.
----- Bro, I have researched this for hours on YouTube and Facebook, and the fire trucks won’t get here any faster, no matter what we do. So why do you care if I pour gasoline on our houses?

-	you, apparently
------ They would have made the same amount but actually getting them in arms as an excercise in distribution is absolutely different.  They literally lost 20 million doses.  Either they were made up or something happened to them.
------- They may have. More vaccines ordered and better distribution infrastructure.
-------- The steps they’ve already taken are a more competent plan than we’ve had for a year though.
-- Imagine actually thinking that this is due to an admin thats been there for less than 2 weeks, and not just a culmination of months of work.
--- [deleted]
--- Trump handled this poorly but the vaccinations were already in motion. Let's not pretend this is happening because of the change in leadership.
---- Trump didn't order enough, then didn't order any more, then had no distribution network plan, then redefined what words meant so they could day things had been distributed when they had only been promised at some future point.
----- Except Biden hasn’t ordered anymore so either Biden also hasn’t ordered enough or Trump did order enough.
----- It is literally public record now that trump did not have a vaccination or pandemic plan of any kind and ordered no additional vaccines for the next administration. either you haven't been paying attention or are deliberately spreading misinformation.
------ Can you link this since it's public record?
------- Uhh he ordered hundreds of millions of vaccines, where do you think the ones we're getting came from?
-------- How did we get to 20 million vaccinated before Biden was sworn in if there was no plan?
---- All I’ll say is imagine if Clinton won in 2016.  Then remember how much people in her own party dislike her and how Republicans outright despise her.  Would the response have been better - maybe???   Would the country have coalesced around the president and followed her guidance - ab-so-fucking-lutely not.   
Just like you had Dem governors playing politics because it was Trump (who was of course doing the same) you would have instead had Republican governors being just as political.   We were doomed either way because we’re obsessed with politics.  We’re not obsessed with right or wrong as much as we are with spite and vitriol.  That’s why.

How do we even get this vaccine? I work in agriculture manufacturing and have been working mandatory 7 days a week since April of 2020, I saw on the news that those in my field were high in the priority for the vaccine yet I have no idea how to even go about getting the damn vaccine.
- I went through your profile and see you've got a Nebraska flair in the politics subreddit, so I looked up their info for you. Nebraska is currently doing phase 1b vaccines which are for people over age 65, people who are older than 18 with a condition that predisposes them to severe covid-19 complications, and people in certain essential career fields (this may vary if you are in a different state). The [Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services page](http://dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/COVID-19-Vaccine-Information.aspx) lists agriculture workers in phase 1b along with some other careers and has a timeline with an estimate of when different groups are expected to be eligible for vaccinations. 

The Nebraska vaccine registration portal is https://Vaccinate.NE.Gov. You can fill out a questionnaire here and schedule an appointment to get vaccinated when there is an opening.

I hope you can get vaccinated soon! If you are not in Nebraska, searching Google for "[Your state] covid-19 vaccinations" is likely to return your state's official information page as one of the first results. Look for a site ending in .gov for official information straight from your local government.

I am in Texas and it is piecemeal here, every county has to try to set up its own vaccine distribution sites and there is no statewide registration website to get vaccinated so you have to hunt down the closest vaccine provider and find out what website or phone number to use in order to get on their wait list. I live near a small city surrounded by forests and rural towns and people have been driving hours from Dallas to get vaccinated here by one of our hospitals because they can't find out where to get vaccinated in the DFW area. If you can't find statewide info in your area, you may need to search for your city or county to see if there is a local vaccination program and registration site.
-- Oh wow you're amazing! Thank you for doing that for me!
--- That was very nice of you to do that. Kudos for helping out.
-- >have been working mandatory 7 days a week since April of 2020

How do you tolerate that? I would have quit.
--- Try looking up your state's vaccination plan/site.  Or just Google "How to get Covid vaccine in ____".  It actually works.

I'm waiting to see how people spin this in to bad news.
- Let me try:

The title states cases, but really, it should say confirmed cases.

The number of cases in the US is estimated at ~1/3rd of the population, or 110M, meaning they've actually only vaccinated a fraction of the total cases in US.

In reality, the fact that they hit this milestone already is more a testament to the horrible job done of testing the US population than it is a celebration of successful vaccinations. If they did a good job testing, we'd be far from this milestone.

How did I do?
-- Pessimists unite!
-- Finland is already at 3x vaccinated vs confirmed cases.

- Actually, we've hit the same milestone. The only difference is we had fewer cases and now we have fewer vaccinations.

Lol go back to your three lifted F350s and your oil-subsidized McMansion in Fort McMiddleOfNowhere. This isn't about the economy. It's about saving lives. Keystone XL has literally nothing to do with the pandemic. 

>Combine that with some horrible domestic policies and never before seen levels of debt means the next few years quite horrible.

Ah yes, because as we all know, the time for the government to stop spending money is *during an economic recession.* Did you graduate high school?
---- Biden literally said in his campaign that if he wins, he'd cancel the pipeline. He said this TWO years aho. Hell, this pipeline had a hard time going through the obama administration. Alberta decided to invest in this peoject despite have such a large opposition. This pipeline wasnt even a 50/50 chance.
----- Keystone pipeline is a joke. The worst oil sludge in the world, ruining our environment. Just to get shipped to another country. . Even ranchers were fighting them putting it on their property for years. Look up canada oil sands and look what that crap is doing to the environment. Horrible

CDCs own website 95% confidence interval that there’s likely 1:4.6 cases (in the US) reported making the total more like 80 million. I’m not sure why people don’t acknowledge this number more on mainstream news or on Reddit. Adding in the total vaccinated with the projected reported cases, and then add in the projected vaccinated per day can give us a realistic timeline of herd immunity. The % of people getting the vaccine that already have antibodies is another question, that IMO is the only variable needed to give a sophisticated guess on when that day will come.

I can't wait to get mine! I'm pretty low on the list. But, once they open it up for the general public, I'm there!
-------------43 top level comment start--------------
Let’s go!
-------------44 top level comment start--------------
I’m extremely excited for my turn.
-------------45 top level comment start--------------
I’m so thankful that I am in the number of vaccinated.

Good news finally

Enjoying the good news from this sub lately!

Some good news
-------------49 top level comment start--------------
I just wish I hadn't had gotten it right before vaccine roll out was starting to happen. I hope the virus doesn't come to bite me in the butt later down the line, luckily I really didn't have many symptoms but some of the headlines and stories still have me worried.

It's like the part in plague inc where the blue bar is growing and you know you're going to lose- only I'm happy about it because it's real life
-------------51 top level comment start--------------
Hallelujah. I know it’s not close to being over but it’s damn good to read some positive news for a change. We can do this America!
-------------52 top level comment start--------------
After nearly a year of constant detriment, this news feels surreal. We’ve got a long way to go, but what a great step!
-------------53 top level comment start--------------
At this rate, we could expect a fairly normal year by around mid-late summer assuming the general population gets vaccinated by around April-June (based on the Massachusetts covid vaccination rollout, but expect around the same for most states.)
-------------54 top level comment start--------------
Keep it coming.

Well its been real guys.. working from home and all. :( I knew this day would come.  no more fresh lunches, no more comfy work clothes no more living. :(

“Got to admit it’s getting better/ a little better all the time”

Aaaand now I think I’m gonna binge some Beatles albums tomorrow while I work.

(Also I can’t believe this has been up this long and no one has referenced this yet...)
-------------57 top level comment start--------------
Finally a decent milestone for the first time since this bullshit started. PS I can’t believe I used to just let people breathe on me in public! Hahah
-------------58 top level comment start--------------
I have my appointment Wednesday. I work in healthcare so I'm the only one in my family eligible. It will reduce the risk to all of us, but I really wish they could do it on a household basis. If my wife were to get sick, knowing I'm vaccinated I'll spiral into guilt. God forbid if she were to die what it'd do to me. Sure, I'll be healthy enough to take care of her, but there's not a whole hell of a lot you can do against a virus other than treat symptoms and I don't have a ventilation or ECMO laying around.

Great news!
-------------60 top level comment start--------------
The dude playing plauge inc is probably getting nervous right about now.
-------------61 top level comment start--------------
Aren't we still in phase 1A though? I'm in the 1A tier but they already ran out of vaccines before I could get one. They need to just deploy FEMA already.
-------------62 top level comment start--------------
GOP: Great news, Don’t need more stimulus now!  /s
-------------63 top level comment start--------------
I can’t believe something positive about the US has hit the front page...
-------------64 top level comment start--------------
I just got mine scheduled finally today. My immediate family has managed to stay safe so far but it does feel like a waiting game sometimes
-------------65 top level comment start--------------
And getting the vaccines might be a little faster now that the Biden Administration just announced they’ll be shipping the vaccines directly to pharmacies.
-------------66 top level comment start--------------
And I'm still sitting over here with cancer and no vaccine.
-------------67 top level comment start--------------
I was grateful for my first day as a vaccinator yesterday.

This feels like the point in "Plague Inc." where you realize that you (the disease) lost.
-------------72 top level comment start--------------
Why is it that CNN is still posting headlines about us being doomed and the worst is coming etc etc. who do you believe lol.

Non-American outside observer here: it's very curious how the moment Trump left office the Coronavirus news suddenly went from grim, post-apocalyptic reporting to positive. It's like the sun came out all of a sudden out of the collective media's asses. 

And no, you can't attribute all the positive news to Biden, he's been in office a week at most: the groundwork for this was set up by Trump's administration. As much of an idiot Trump was, it's obvious the media REALLY hated Donald Trump.
- Yep, I agree. It's bizarre, and biased. But most here will probably say it's not, or come up with an excuse to explain it away. Funny thing that cognitive dissonance, it creates problems no matter political affiliation.
-------------77 top level comment start--------------
Sorry to say, this is not a Joe Biden Win. This is Trump vaccines and the decline after Christmas and New Years.

Christmas + New Years was inevitably going to spike the cases over the month of January and decline after those infection periods.

The million vaccines a day was already happening under Trump, and Joe's Mask Mandate is not going to work that quickly as some would have you believe.
-------------78 top level comment start--------------
Oj Simpson vaccinated before teachers.... hmmmm... this news would be better if they were vaccinating high risk people first
-------------79 top level comment start--------------
Huh. The results of proper leadership...
-------------80 top level comment start--------------
Imagine that!  Masks, and vaccines have positive results!  Who would have thought?!
-------------81 top level comment start--------------
This is some good fucking news. All-day it's been GME down. This is wonderful news.
-------------82 top level comment start--------------
Can we get the folks at r/numerology to make up some more completely arbitrary milestones
-------------83 top level comment start--------------
Wow the turnaround time was really fast!
-------------84 top level comment start--------------
Finally.
-------------85 top level comment start--------------
Excellent.

I hope we keep the pace up.
-------------86 top level comment start--------------
Great news! The caveat is more vaccinated than CONFIRMED cases. Still, don't wanna take away from feeling good about something.
-------------87 top level comment start--------------
The curve has been flattened!
-------------88 top level comment start--------------
an astounding, astonishing milestone. we definitely are proud
-------------89 top level comment start--------------
Thank fuck a certain somebody is gone.

I got both of my doses and my parents are gettkng their first one vaccine. The year is going in the right direction
-------------93 top level comment start--------------
I’d really like to know where these fucking vaccines are. My mom is 70, has cancer, and I’ve got her on every list in my area and she is STILL waiting.

This is refreshing news. Keep the good news coming.

This headline was written by someone who still sits in the back seat of the car and blinks whenever they see telephone poles, pretending lasers shoot out and trying to time it correctly.

I began to tear up reading that and thought. Finally, fucking finally.

Good to see the greatest country in the world is catching up to the rest of the world.
-------------100 top level comment start--------------
That's wonderful but I simultaneously hear nothing about vaccines locally. Don't know of a single person who's not a medical worker who's had it and I'm hearing nothing about teachers getting it anytime soon.
- Where are you located? 

I’m in AZ and we’re already rolling into the teacher group - I’ve got my first shot and most of the staff at my school have either gotten one dose or are scheduled for it soon
-- I'm in ME, not a word about teachers getting it, just those 70+ but even then I've not heard much in the way of that happening.
-------------101 top level comment start--------------
Thank you medical science, very cool.
-------------102 top level comment start--------------
Awesome. I knew if I took enough of a break from this place eventually something good would happen

Soooo, we done then?
-------------108 top level comment start--------------
I'm in a high risk group and signed up to get the vaccine ASAP. I'm happy to take it.

One thing that makes me angry is that at least in some jurisdictions, folks jump the line with claims that aren't true.

"I am a daycare worker." (person is retired, watches grandchild once a week.) It just really gets to me. There are people who risk their lives, and you're jumping the line? ... .. yeah no I will not talk to you again.
-------------109 top level comment start--------------
FINALLY a record to be proud of
-------------110 top level comment start--------------
Not rich enough, or old enough to get a vaccine, anytime soon. Rough estimates for me, and my family are April. 

So damn frustrating losing everything, while watching some folks that found a way to get go back to normal. That’s great for the people that are following the guidelines. Not everyone is. Watching younger folks that got it because their family has hospital administrators, bs like that doesn’t really help my faith in humanity. It’s still about who you know. The “extras” are told to people, so they’re in the right place at the right time. I’ve been told my life doesn’t matter, and I believe it when I see people skipping the line. By the time some of get help, it’s not going to matter. We’ll be out on the streets. It’s really hard, after a year of isolation, to not hate everyone.

Question, will the vaccinated trend downward when our current order with the vaccine producers ends or has the US already handled stock for the future?

This is great news! Tired of always hearing negative things.
